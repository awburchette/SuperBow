Add a command to reload the config file without restarting the server.
Redo the way fire arrows work.
The config file would be like this:

SuperBow:
	Default:
		damageMultiplier: 1
		fireArrows:
			flight: false
			entities: false
			blocks: false
	bitswitch:
		damageMultiplier: 1
		fireArrows:
			flight: true
			entities: true
			blocks: true
			
flight would set it so the arrow is on fire during the time it's in flight on stuck in a block.
entities would set it so the arrow would set players, hostile mobs, and neutral mobs on fire if shot with the arrow
blocks would set it so the arrow would set the block that it hits on fire.
