Bukkit Plugin: SuperBow
Author: bitswitch

Let's players have customized arrows.
Each player can be configured in the config.yml in plugins/SuperBow/
If a player does not have their own section in the file it will give
them the values under the Default entry.

Current options:
damageMultiplier - Changes how much damage an arrow does.
useFireArrows - The arrow is on fire during it's existence and will set any entity(player and mobs) shot with it on fire until it kills them.

In the example config below bitswitch's arrows will set entities on fire and do (normal arrow damage)*5
while everyone else's arrows act as arrows normally do.

Example config:

SuperBow:
    Default:
        damageMultiplier: 1
        useFireArrows: false
    bitswitch:
        damageMultiplier: 5
        useFireArrows: true
