Bukkit Plugin: SuperBow
Author: Anthony "bitswitch" Burchette

Let's players have customized arrows.
The arrows can be set to be on fire during flight, set entities on fire, set blocks on fire, and change the amount of damage they do.

Permissions nodes:
	SuperBow.help
	SuperBow.info
	SuperBow.damage
	SuperBow.flight
	SuperBow.entity
	SuperBow.block
	
*The config file only holds default values and users current settings.*
Each player can be configured in the config.yml in plugins/SuperBow/
If a player does not have their own section in the file it will give
them the values under the Default entry.

Current options:
damageMultiplier - Changes how much damage an arrow does.
fireArrows.block - The arrow will set the block it hits on fire. (Currently not working)
fireArrows.entity - The arrow will set any entity(player and mobs) shot with it on fire until it kills them.
fireArrows.flight - The arrow is on fire during it's existence

In the example config below bitswitch's arrows will set entities on fire, blocks on fire, be on fire during flight, and do (normal arrow damage)*5
while everyone else's arrows act as arrows normally do.

Example config:

SuperBow:
    Default:
        damageMultiplier: 1
        fireArrows:
            block: false
            entity: false
            flight: false
    Users:
        bitswitch:
            damageMultiplier: 5
            fireArrows:
                block: true
                entity: true
                flight: true
